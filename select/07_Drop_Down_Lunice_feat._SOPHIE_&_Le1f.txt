Itty bitty kitty crept up to my house
I gave her a treat and she went boom pow
An itty bitty kitty crept up to my house
I gave her a treat and she dropped down
Itty bitty kitty crept up to my house
I gave her a treat and she went boom pow
An itty bitty kitty crept up to my house
I gave her a treat and she dropped down

House, boom, pow
House, drop down
House, boom, pow
House, drop down

Is my mind playing tricks with me? I think I see a kitty
I think I see a kitty, I think I see a kitty
Is she new to the city? Just winning, sitting pretty
I think I see a kitty, I think I see a kitty
Is my mind playing tricks with me? I think I see a kitty
I think I see a kitty, I think I see a kitty
Is she new to the city? Just winning, sitting pretty
I think I see a kitty, I think I see a kitty

House, boom, pow
House, drop down
House, boom, pow
House, drop down
